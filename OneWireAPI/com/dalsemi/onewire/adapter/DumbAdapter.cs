	/// the iB-IDE's emulator.  The <code>DumbAdapter</code> allows
	/// programmers to add and remove <code>OneWireContainer</code>
	/// objects that will be found in its search.  The Java iButton
	/// emulator works by creating a class that subclasses all of
	/// <code>OneWireContainer16</code>'s relevant methods and redirecting them
	/// to the emulation code.  That object is then added to this class's
	/// list of <code>OneWireContainer</code>s.</para>
	/// 
	/// <para>Note that methods such as <code>selectPort</code> and
	/// <code>beginExclusive</code> by default do nothing.  This class is
	/// mainly meant for debugging using an emulated iButton.  It will do
	/// a poor job of debugging any multi-threading, port-sharing issues.
